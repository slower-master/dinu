    <h2 style="color:coral">What is SSH</h2>
    <p style="text-decoration: none;">SSH(Secure Shell) is a remote administration protocol that allows users to
        control(or modify) their remote
        servers over the Internet. The service uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication happens in
        an encrypted
        manner. It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the
        host, and the output back to the client.</p>
    <p>Any Linux or macOS user can use SSH directly from the terminal window. Windows users can
        take advantage of SSH clients(for example -Putty).</p>
    <h2 style="color:coral">How Does SSH Work</h2>
    <p>For Linux and Mac users,using SSH is very simple.If you use Windows,you will need to setup SSH client(I prefer
        PuTTY).</p>
    <p>For Mac and Linux users ,Open your terminal program and follow the procedure below:</p>
    <p>The SSH command consists of 3 distinct parts:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px;background-color:grey;padding-top: 10px;padding-bottom: 10px;border-radius: 20px;">ssh
        {user}@{host}
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The SSH key command instructs your system that you want to open an encrypted Secure Shell Connection.</li>
        <li>{user} represents the account you want to access(the user on server).</li>
        <li>{host} refers to the computer you want to access.This can be IP Address or a domain name</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        When you hit enter, you will be prompted to enter the password for the requested account. When you type it in,
        nothing will appear on the screen, but your password is, in fact being transmitted. Once you’re done typing, hit
        enter once again. If your password is correct, you will be greeted with a remote terminal window.</p>

    <h2 style="color:coral">Different Encryption Techniques</h2>
    <p>Everyone like's SSH because of its p use of encryption to ensure secure transfer of information between the host
        and the client.There are three different encryption technologies used by SSH:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Symmetrical encryption</li>
        <li>Asymmetrical encryption</li>
        <li>Hashing.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 style="color:lightseagreen">&nbsp; Symmetrical encryption</h2>
    <p>Symmetric encryption is a form of encryption where a secret key is used for both encryption and
        decryption of a
        message by both the client and the host. Any one by the help of the secret-key can decrypt the message being
        transferred.</p>
    <p>There is usually only one key that is used, or sometimes a pair , where one key can easily be calculated using
        the other key.</p>
    <p>Symmetric keys are used to encrypt the entire communication during a SSH Session. Both the client and the server
        derive the secret key using an agreed method(algorithm), and the resultant key is never disclosed to any third
        party. The
        process of creating a symmetric key is carried out by a key exchange algorithm. What makes this algorithm
        particularly secure is the fact that the key is never transmitted between the client and the host. Instead, the
        two computers share public pieces of data and then manipulate it to independently calculate the secret key. Even
        if another machine captures the publically shared data, it won’t be able to calculate the key because the key
        exchange algorithm is not known.</p>

    <p>It must be noted, however, that the secret token is specific to each SSH session, and is generated prior to
        client authentication. Once the key has been generated, all packets moving between the two machines must be
        encrypted by the private key. This includes the password typed into the console by the user, so credentials are
        always protected from network packet sniffers.</p>
    <h2 style="color:lightseagreen">&nbsp; Asymmetrical encryption</h2>
    <p>Asymmetrical encryption uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. These two keys are known as the
        public key and the private key. Together, both these keys form a public-private key pair.</p>
    <p>
        The public key is openly distributed and shared with all parties. While public key is closely
        linked
        with the private key in terms of functionality but the private key cannot be mathematically computed from the
        public
        key. The relation between the two keys is highly complex. A message that is encrypted by a machine’s public key,
        can
        only be decrypted by the same machine’s private key. Means that the public key cannot
        decrypt
        its own messages, nor can it decrypt anything encrypted by the private key.</p>
    <p>
        The private key must remain private i.e. for the connection to be secured, no third party must ever know it. The
        strength of the entire connection lies in the fact that the private key is never revealed. Therefore, any party
        with
        the
        capability to decrypt publically signed messages must possess the corresponding private key.</p>
    <p>
        Generally asymmetrical encryption is not used to encrypt the entire SSH session. Instead,
        it is
        only used during the key exchange algorithm of symmetric encryption.
        In asymmetrical encryption,
        both
        parties generate temporary public-private key pairs, and share their respective private keys to produce the
        shared
        secret key.</p>
    <p>
        Once a secured symmetric communication has been established, the server uses the clients public key to generate
        and
        challenge and transmit it to the client for authentication. If the client can successfully decrypt the message,
        it
        means that it holds the private key required for the connection. The SSH session then begins.</p>
    <h2 style="color:lightseagreen">&nbsp; Hashing</h2>
    <p>Hashing is another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections. One-way-hash functions differ
        from the above two forms of encryption in the sense that they are never meant to be decrypted. They generate a
        unique value of a fixed length for each input that shows no clear trend which can exploited. This makes them
        practically impossible to reverse.It is easy to generate a cryptographic hash from a given input, but impossible
        to generate the input from the hash.This means that if a client holds the correct input, they can generate the
        crypto-graphic hash and compare its value to verify whether they possess the correct input.</p>
    <h2 style="color:coral"> SSH and These Encryption Techniques</h2>
    <p>The way SSH works is by making use of a client-server model to allow for authentication of two remote systems and
        encryption of the data that passes between them.</p>
    <p>There are two stages to establishing a connection: first both the systems must agree upon encryption standards to
        protect future communications, and second, the user must authenticate themselves. If the credentials match, then
        the user is granted access.</p>
